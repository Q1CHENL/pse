# Vendor Lock-in

- A software project is completely dependent upon one vendorâ€™s implementation
- Consequences
  - Commercial product upgrades drive the application software maintenance cycle
  - Delay/failure of delivery
  - Requires in-depth product knowledge

- Cause
  - No detailed technical inspection
  - Used open standard without effective comformance process

- Solution: more abstraction, middleware, seperation, portability
- Vendor example: Apache Algorithms
