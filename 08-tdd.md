# Test Driven Development

- TDD Cycle
  - Write a test: before writing any other code
  - Get the test to pass: most basic solution
  - Optimize the design: prettier, more readable
  - Repeat
- Why?
  - Tests can serve as concise documentation
  - Report: reduced defect rates, effort, improved design/tech qualities
  > Can be tedious (test everything) and frustrating (stuck to cycle)!
